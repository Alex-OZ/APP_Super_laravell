PRACTIC APP DATABASE OF SUPERHEROES

The basis is a simple Laravel project. This application makes it possible to maintain a database of superheroes, add new ones, 
delete existing ones, edit and view detailed information about them.


FOR START
A project and a new database called "APP" are needed.
MySQl database file is attached. After import and connection, a table with records will be available.

After executing the 'php artisan serv' command, a locally running application will be available which
 can be found at the ip address that appears in the console.
